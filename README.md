# examples-dev

This repository contains the example notebooks and scripts for
the IDAES-PSE code. Some examples are Jupyter Notebooks, and
some are Python scripts.

The examples can be viewed online at 
[this page](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples).

## Installation

To run the examples, you will need to install them locally.
This requires that you install the 
IDAES Process Systems Engineering (IDAES-PSE) toolkit.
IDAES-PSE is in a 
[public repository on Github](https://github.com/idaes/idaes-pse)
Full installation instructions are available on the
[install page](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/index.html) 
of the online documentation.

For most people, the easiest way to run these examples is to use the 
[idaes install-examples](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install-examples.html)
command that is part of the IDAES-PSE toolkit. This will download 
and install the examples, and their documentation, in the local system.
From there, you can browse the directory you chose to install them
in and run the scripts or Jupyter Notebooks (see next section if you
need help with this).

Some people may want to work directly with the examples repository
on Github, which is at [https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse](https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse)

## Running the examples

Once you have installed the examples, and IDAES-PSE, you can run
either the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
To run the Python scripts, navigate to the directory in which they
are held and either use a command (see this 
[page on how to run Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html))
or run them in an IDE like
