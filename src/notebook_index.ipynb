    "# IDAES Examples\n",
    "This page is an introduction and index into the IDAES examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "The content below is contained in Jupyter Notebooks. In order to view and\n",
    "use this content, you need to open the files with Jupyter. This page has\n",
    "designed to be your \"landing page\", that you can (and should) also open in\n",
    "Jupyter. More here...\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to use these examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The example notebooks contained in this folder are divided into notebooks that\n",
    "are written as tutorials, and those that are written more simply as working\n",
    "examples of IDAES features. These are stored under the \"Tutorials\" and \"Examples\"\n",
    "directories, respectively. Here is a short guide on how to use these examples\n",
    "to progressively learn how to use the IDAES Core Modeling Framework (IDAES-CMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beginner\n",
    "    * Start with the tutorials under [Tutorials/Basics](#tutorials-basics)\n",
    "    * Run the examples under [Examples/Basics](#examples-basics)\n",
    "* Intermediate\n",
    "    * Run some selected examples under [Tutorials/UnitModels](#tutorials-unitmodels)\n",
    "    * Also run at least one tutorial in Tutorials/Advanced/Custom unit models and\n",
    "      Tutorials/Advanced/Custom property packages\n",
    "    * (At this point you should stop and try some of your own code)\n",
    "* Advanced\n",
    "    * Run tutorials in [Tutorials/Advanced](#tutorials-advanced) for topics of interest\n",
    "    * Also run examples in the [Examples/Advanced](#examples-advanced) section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks (and supporting files) are broken into two major categories,\n",
    "and folders: Tutorials and Examples. Most of the notebooks are in the Tutorials folder.\n",
    "These notebooks cover their\n",
    "material in an instructive manner with explanatory text and, often, embedded exercises with solutions.\n",
    "The examples notebooks may also have explanation, but they are less guided\n",
    "demonstrations of the application of IDAES to a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, you can find a guide to all the current tutorial and\n",
    "example notebooks, with embedded links that, if you are reading this in\n",
    "a Jupyter notebook environment, allow you to jump directly to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorials\n",
    "All the notebooks in this folder have three different files\n",
    "that represent different variations on the same content: (a) `<notebook_name>_exercise.ipynb` is the\n",
    "main tutorial notebook, with embedded exercise cells; (b) `<notebook_name>_solution.ipynb`\n",
    "is the tutorial notebook, with solutions to the exercises after each one;\n",
    "(c) `<notebook_name>_solution_testing.ipynb` adds additional cells to test the\n",
    "correctness of the solution, and does not normally need to be opened by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of reading, we will use simply `<notebook_name>` below, e.g.\n",
    "for a notebook called \"hello\" we will use `hello` -- to run the tutorial,\n",
    "you would really open `hello_exercise.ipynb` or `hello_solution.ipynb`.\n",
