    "## Module 4b: Parameter Estimation Using Flash Unit Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will be using Pyomo's `parmest` tool in conjuction with IDAES models for parameter estimation. We will demonstrate these tools by estimating the parameters associated with the NRTL property model for a benzene-toluene mixture. The NRTL model has 2 sets of parameters: the non-randomness parameter (`alpha_ij`) and the binary interaction parameter (`tau_ij`), where `i` and `j` is the pure component species. In this example, we will be only estimate the binary interaction parameter (`tau_ij`) for a given dataset. When estimating parameters associated with the property package, IDAES provides the flexibility of doing the parameter estimation by just using the state block or by using a unit model with a specified property package. This module will demonstrate parameter estimation by using the flash uni model with NRTL property package. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will complete the following task:\n",
    "* Set up a method to return an initialized model\n",
    "* Set up the parameter estimation problem\n",
    "* Analyze the results\n",
    "* Demonstrate advanced features from `parmest`\n",
