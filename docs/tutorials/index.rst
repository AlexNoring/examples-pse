IDAES Tutorials
===============

The tutorials linked below are Jupyter Notebooks, which create and run IDAES models.
They provide a thorough introduction to the capabilities
of the IDAES PSE framework. They were originally presented at a stakeholder meeting
in May of 2019. Each tutorial presents the creation of models, etc., as a series
of steps with extensive context and information. Each tutorial builds on information
from the prior one, so it is recommended that the new user view them in order.
