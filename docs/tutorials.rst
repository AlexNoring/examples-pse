Tutorials
=========
The tutorials linked below are Jupyter Notebooks, which create and run IDAES models.
They provide a thorough introduction to the capabilities
of the IDAES PSE framework. They were originally presented at a stakeholder meeting
in May of 2019. Each tutorial presents the creation of models, etc., as a series
of steps with extensive context and information. Each tutorial builds on information
from the prior one, so it is recommended that the new user view them in order.

If you want to run these Jupyter notebooks yourself, you need to download the source code for the IDAES toolkit and then navigate to
`examples/workshops` and its subdirectories. You would load a given tutorial with the command::

    jupyter notebook <notebook-file-name.ipynb>

Then, in the Jupyter interface, you could select "Run all" to see the tutorial executed
in front of you.
