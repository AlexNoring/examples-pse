# IDAES Examples

See the main README.md for user instructions.

## Developer information

The documentation is built by running the `build.py` script in this directory.

Run `python build.py --help` to see basic help information and `python build.py --usage`
to see a more detailed explanation of usage.

If you add new directories with Jupyter notebooks, you will need to let the
script know about them by adding the directories (and the desired target directory
for the rendered documentation) to the `build.yml` file in this directory.
The comments in that file should explain how to add the new information.
